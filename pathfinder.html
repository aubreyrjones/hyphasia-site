        Hi! <br>I'm so glad you're interested in exploring Hyphasia with me. The group is small right now, so I'm handling everything by email.
    </p>
    <p>
        This isn't a sales list. I'm going to email when I upload a new build of Hyphasia with a link and the patch notes. That's it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In return, I hope <em>you'll</em>
        email me with your notes about sounds and experiences. This isn't a technical test; I really need help figuring out what this instrument can sound like
        and where to concentrate new work.
    </p>
    <p>
        I just need the email address you'd like to use.
            <form
                action="https://formspree.io/f/xaqozwnw"
                method="POST"
                class="pf-signup"
                >
                <label class="sr-only" for="pf-email">Email</label>
                <input
                    id="pf-email"
                    type="email"
                    name="email"
                    placeholder="your email"
                    autocomplete="email"
                    required
                    class="pf-signup__input"
                />
                <button type="submit" class="pf-signup__btn" aria-label="Submit email">

                </button>
