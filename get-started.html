    <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
    <p>
        The most important thing you should do before using Hyphasia is update your GPU (video card) drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hyphasia uses only basic hardware features, so you can expect support for some older <em>hardware</em>, but the software requires recent 
        drivers supporting Vulkan&nbsp;1.3. If your hardware does not have drivers with support for Vulkan&nbsp;1.3, it will not be possible to run 
        Hyphasia until you upgrade to a GPU with modern driver support.

    <h1>Installing Hyphasia</h1>
    
        <p><strong>All formats:</strong> first download the `VC_redist.x64.exe` and install it. You only need to do this once on each machine--even if you download a new version of Hyphasia later.</p>
        <p><strong>Standalone:</strong> download the `.exe` anywhere convenient and double-clicked to launch. No specific steps are required to install it. 
          Windows may warn you about unsigned code. Click ‘More info → Run anyway’.</p>
        <p><strong>VST:</strong> download the `.vst.zip` file and unzip it into your system VST directory (often `C:\Program Files\VstPlugins\`, but it may depend on your DAW). 
            You should unzip the entire directory (with name ending in `.vst`) as-is.</p>
