        <h1>Phase Sculpture Synthesis</h1>
        <p>
            Phase Sculpture Synthesis began with the observation that an inverse FFT could be used not as a reconstruction step,
            but as a continuously driven audio generator. This concept has been hinted at and occasionally approached in digital
            synthesis research, but never realized as an instrument for interactive performance.
        </p>

        <p>
            By treating each synthetic result as a loopable audio "snapshot" instead of a linear block of time-bound samples, 
            PSS directly addresses the typical resolution vs. latency tradeoff thought to be inherent in IFFT synthesis. A very large
            IFFT block size gives extremely fine frequency control over the entire audible range, while resynthesis from a smoothly evolving 
            spectrum enables modulation and control without perceptual latency--even when resynthesis occurs at much lower 
            than the audio sample rate. 
        </p>

        <p>
            PSS easily models transients by treating them as amplitude evolution across subsequent snapshots instead of regions of samples
            within a single linear timeline. This locally-acausal, globally-evolving regime eliminates the majority of complaints typically leveled
            against synthesis techniques based on IFFT primitives. The remaining problems are ones of performance and musical control.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Large, loopable waveforms enable computational decoupling between the synthesis process and the playback process. Playback can continue
            at whatever rate the host environment requires, while the <em>state</em> of what is played back evolves at its own rate. This decoupling 
            unlocks an entire design space of asynchronous computational speedups--including complete GPU offload.
        </p>

        <p>
            PSS also solves the control problem--populating tens of thousands of FFT bins with interesting, varying spectra--by treating it as an energy
            distribution problem. The choice of control topology then defines the musical feel of an instrument built on PSS.
            Besides the stochastic spectra used in Hyphasia, control topologies could be built on sampled spectra, fluid or diffusion-reaction models,
            physical instrument simulation, analytical fields, or any other scheme that can be made C1 continuous.
        </p>

        <p>
            While the roots of phase sculpture synthesis are almost as old as digital synthesis itself, it was not possible to assemble the pieces
            in this way before the widespread adoption of compute-capable GPUs. Furthermore, previously available techniques for accessing the GPU
            where either non-portable (CUDA) or offered no meaningful control over scheduling and latency (OpenGL/OpenCL). 
            Bounded-latency access to GPU resources through modern frameworks such as Metal and Vulkan was a necessary prerequisite for PSS to evolve.
