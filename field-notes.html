  <p>
    These notes are written as Hyphasia takes form in the void. It is unclear how much is certain 
    and what remains unshaped. The instrument responds to observation.

    <h2>Tactile Observations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The left mouse button is primary, working all manner of controls.</li>
      <li>Ctrl-click on a slider permits directly naming a value.</li>
      <li>A long left click summons a field in the void. The middle mouse button adjusts it.</li>
      <li>A left double click in the void clears away distraction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Voices</h2>

    <p>
      Particles are energy. There is no sound, no light, without them. Each voice must be built by emitting particles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Earlier parameters have more power. Lower ones are more subtle.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a sound to be loud, it must have many particles. A quiet sound will have few. 
      A sudden sound will emit all its particles together. A crescendo grows as a stream.
    </p>

    <p>
      Phase mod and a particle's acceleration are linked. The results are unpredictable and not always gentle.

    <h2>Effectors</h2>
    
    <p>
      A very unstable plane. Dynamic and unknown.
    </p>

    <p>
      Purple fields do nothing, their power latent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Attractor's acceleration stimulates phase mod.
