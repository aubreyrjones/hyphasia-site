    <h2>What is Hyphasia?</h2>
    <p>
        Hyphasia is an infinitely polyphonic, microtonal synthesizer built around phase sculpture synthesis.
    </p>
    <p>
         More broadly, it's a deeply configurable audiovisual instrument with a unique sound design space and dazzling live visuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        In short: the particles are the instrument.

    <h2>What's special about phase sculpture synthesis?</h2>
    <p>
        PSS builds sound from scratch, exciting the spectrum to create a phase-coherent, loop-stable waveform. Resynthesizing the waveform many times a second
        enables rich modulation and stage-ready response.
    </p>
    <p>
        A good metaphor is to imagine a phonograph. The record spins, but the tone arm stays in the same spot, playing back whatever's under it. Phase sculpture 
        synthesis works by constantly swapping out the record with a new one, created fresh from the performer's input.

    <p>
        Hyphasia is a GPU-native synth. It needs a reasonably modern graphics card
        with Vulkan&nbsp;1.3 support and at least 2&nbsp;GiB of VRAM. Additional instances may require additional VRAM.
        Older or integrated GPUs may struggle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On Apple platforms, Apple&nbsp;Silicon (M1 or later) is required.
    </p>
    <!-- Implementation is ongoing for these features.
    <p>
        Hyphasia natively supports 16-channel MIDI, MIDI MPE, and MIDI 2.0 per-note expression.
    </p>
